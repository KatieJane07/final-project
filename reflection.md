# Final Project Reflection

## What advice would I give myself
- I wish I stuck with my original idea with the blinking mechanism, I think it would've been more difficult but I also think I would have been more proud of the result
- I think I set my expectations for myself too high for this project, I expected it to be a lot more visually appealing and because of that my time spent coding was overshadowed by my time spent designing
- I tried to do something that relied too much on skills I did not have such as animation

- Stick to the blinking
- Don't worry as much about design and visuals
- Focus on coding skills rather than design skills

## Was everything on my needs to have list completed?
- Yes! In a way...
- There is at least one instance of everything on that list working properly
- different scenes/ levels -> Works well, I have many different parts and scenes
- videos / cutscenes -> I have 2 working videos I use as cutscenes, originally I wanted more but timewise I couldnt create them
- audio narration -> I dont have audio narration because I ran out of time to record but I do have visual narration (subtitles) and background music
- mouse interaction / game element -> I have 3 "games", the first one works perfectly, the second one isn't really a game but has mouse interaction and works as intended, and the third one works kind of
- I also have some of my nice to have list
- some sort of animation -> animated cutscenes
- Choose your own adventure elements -> choices section

## What was the hardest part of this project?
- Motivating myself probably
- Like I said earlier, I set too high of expectations for myself and when I saw that it wasn't turning out how I wanted it to I was kind of disappointed and lost motivation to work on it
- Also balancing time between designing and coding
- Also I did multiple things that made my laptop crash and I thought I was going to lose a bunch of my code but I didn't!!
- Although each section is rather simple, just the amount of things I was putting together was kind of hard to deal with

## Problems I did not solve
- There are some design things I didn't have time to fix, like the cutscene text scenes
- I am pretty sure the background music works but my laptop can't run it very well
