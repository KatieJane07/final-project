# Project Description
For the final project I want to make a game that uses blinking to progress the storyline. 

## Needs to Have
- Eye tracking but also space bar input (for without cam) https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/d-JfFcGws
- blinking switches frame
- storyline
- videos
- audio narration

## Nice to Have
- mouse interaction / game element
- some sort of animation
- eye tracking movement, more than just blinking
- some sort of customization
- track head movement
