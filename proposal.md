# Project Description
For the final project I want to make a game/story that takes you through the life of something. 
I plan to add blinking to switch between scenes of the story.

## Needs to Have
- different scenes/ levels
- videos
- audio narration


## Nice to Have
- blinking switches frame
- mouse interaction / game element
- some sort of animation
- eye tracking movement, more than just blinking
- some sort of customization
