# Project Description
For the final project I want to make a game/story that takes you first person through the life of guy who turned into a cat. 
The story will then lead the player through the process of becoming human again. With that, there will be stories/video-esq scenes and little mini games.

I plan to add blinking to switch between scenes of the story. If not blinking, then space bar.
